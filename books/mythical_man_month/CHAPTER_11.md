# Chapter 11: Plan to Throw One Away

"It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.

## Pilot Plants and Scaling Up

* Chemical Eningeers learned long ago that a process that works in the labratory cannot be implemented in a factory in only one step
* An intermediate step called the `pilot plant` is necessary to give experience in scaling qualitites up and in oprating in nonprotective encironments
  * Start with a 10,000 gal/day plant
  * Then do the 2,000,000 gal/day plant

### The only decision you have is to plan to build the throw away or promise to deliver the trhowaway to the customers

## Planning for Change

* The throw-one-away concept is itself just an acceptance of the fact that as one learns, he changes the design
* Strategies to make change less impactful:
  * Minimize interdependencies
  * Use good documentation (self documentation) to make changes clear
  * Quantify change as well
    * Product versions need to be numbered
    * Set scheduled freeze dates as well
      * (After a freeze date, changes go to the next release)

## Plan the Organization for Change

* The reluctance to document designs doesnt come fron laziness or time pressure
  * Rather, it comes from the desigerns reluctance to commit himself to the defense of decisions which he knows to be tenative
* Management structures also need to change as the system changes

## Two Steps Forward and One Step Back (Maintenance)

* Cost of maintaining is typically 40% of the cost of development
* More users find more bugs
* Fixing a defect has a 20-50% change of introducing another

## One Step Forward and One Step Back

* Eventually, so much maintenance has been done that the original system is compromised
* Each "fix" introduces equally as many problems
* Deviations from the original system lead to an increase in entropy and disorder

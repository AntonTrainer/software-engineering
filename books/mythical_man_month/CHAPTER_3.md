# Chapter 3: The Surgical Team

## The Problem

* One study on best and worst performers showed ratios of:
  * Productivity 10:1
  * Programming speed and space 5:1

## Mills's Proposal

* Large systems should be segmented and addressed by surgical teams - not like hog butchers
  * One person does the cutting, and everyone else supports the cutter
  * As opposed to everyone cutting different parts

### Roles

* **The Surgeon**
  * Hyper experienced in the full end to end process
* **The Copilot**
  * Like the Surgeon but less qualified
  * Free to think about ideas and suggest them
    * Surgeon can disregard any and all ideas tho
* **The Administrator**
  * Supports the Surgeon by providing people and resource management
* **The Editor**
  * Responsible for all documentation
  * At the whim of editing requests by the Surgeon
* **Two Secretaries**
  * The Administrator and Editor will each need a secretary
  * Administrators secretary handles project correspondance and non-product files
* **The Program Clerk**
  * Responsible for maintaining all technical records of the team in a programming-product library
  * Must be able to understant code
    * Catalogues stuff
  * Logs all updates
  * Handles the integrity of the growing product
* **The Toolsmith**
  * Basically the admin team to make sure all resources the Surgeon needs are in working order and up to his expectations
* **The Tester**
  * Need a bank of test cases for the code
  * Plans testing sequences and sets up required scaffolding
* **The Language Lawyer**
  * Basically good for little teeny tiny portions that require a superbly deep knowledge of the language itself
  * As opposed to the surgeon who is a builder

#### Works better in smaller projects, but if not possible just need the System Architecture completely designed first

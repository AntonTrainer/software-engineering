# Chapter 14: Hatching a Catastrophe

"How does a project get to be a year late? ....One project at a time"

"Usually, the disaster is due to termites, not tornadoes"

## Milestones or Millstones

"Fuzzy milestones are the harded burden to live with. It is in fact a millstone that grinds down morale for it decieves one about lost time until it is irremediable"

* First step to controlling a schedule is to *have* a schedule
  * Have a list of events, milestones, with dates
    * Picking these dates is an estimation problem
  * For picking milestones, there is only one rule:
    * Milestones must be concrete, specific, measurable events defined with knife-edge sharpness
  * Bad measures
    * Coding is "90% done" during 50% of development
    * Debugging is "99% done" 90% of the time
  * Good measures
    * Specifications signed by all architects and implementers
    * Source coding 100% complete, keypunched, entered into disk library
    * Debugged version passes all test cases"

## Under the Rug

* There are two rug-lifting techniques the boss needs to use
  * Both must be used
* First, is to reduce the role conflict and inspire sharing of status
* Second, is to yank the rug back

### Reducing Role Conflict

* Boss must distinguish between
  * Action information
  * Status information
* Boss musnt act on problems that the managers can solve
* Must **never** act on problems when he is explicitly reviewing status

### Yanking the Rug Off

* Is good to have review techniques that show the true status
* Can be helpful to have a two copies of milestone dates:
  * "Schedulde dates" that senior managers have and are working towards
  * "Estimated dates" that low level managers maintain as the closest dates to reality
  * Senior managers must resist the urge to effect estimated dates as reality is the best information available

# Chapter 2: The Mythical Man-Month

* More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than all other causes combined.
  * Why? **Estimates suck ass**
  * Estimates reflect unvoiced assumptions
  * They also confuse effort with progress, and mistakenly interchange man with months
  * Scheduled progress is poorly monitored
    * Techniques proven and routine in other disciplines are considered radical in software
  * Furthermore, when falling behind the response is to add more manpower

## Optimism

* We are overly optimistic as programmers (haha)
* Actually converting thoughts into ideas is very imprecise and error prone - tis the human condition

## The Man-Month

* This unit of measurement is not good
* The assumption is that men are interchangable
  * Overlooks the necessity of communication
  * As communication rises, so do inefficiencies as well as complexity
* "The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned. Many software tasks have this characterisitic because of the sequential nature of debugging"

## Systems Tests

* Scheduling these is about as horrific as debugging scheduling

### Rules of Thumb

* 1/3 planning
* 1/6 coding
* 1/4 component test and early system test
* 1/4 system test, all components in hand

## Gutless Estimating

* Until better estimating arrives, individual managers need to stiffen their backbones and defend their estimates
  * Bad hunches are better than wish derived estimates

# Chapter 5: The Second-System Effect

* Need to ensure that the architect and the builder maintain good communication lines
  * Cannot let the archtiect get overzealous

## Interactive Discipline for the Architect

* Architects have their own estimates
* Builders have their own estimates
  * Need to reconcile differences somehow
    * 1) Cut the design challange
    * 2) Tell the builder how to do it cheaper
      * Remember the builder has the inventive and creative responsibility for the implementation, so the architect suggests, not dictates
      * Always be prepared to suggest *a* way of implementing anything he specifies, and be prepared to accept any other way that also meets the objectives
      * Deal quietly and privately in such suggestions
      * Be ready tro forego credit for suggested improvements

## Self-Discipline - The Second-System Effect

### "The second system is the most dangerous system a man ever designs"

* There is a general tendancy to over-design the second system
  * Via adding all the frills and ideas missed on the first system
* How to avoid?
  * Ensure the senior architect has at least two systems under his belt

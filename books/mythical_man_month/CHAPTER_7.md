# Chapter 7: Why Did the Tower of Babel Fail?

Difficulty communicating due to language differences

## Why it failed

* It lacked: *communication,* and its consequent, *organization*
* Inability to coordinate is a death sentence

## How teams should communicate

* **Informally**
  * Good telephone service and a clear definintion of intergroup dependencies will encourage the hundreds of calls upon which common interpretation of written documents depends
* **Meetings**
  * Regular project meetings, with one team after another giving technical briefings, are invaluable
  * Hundreds of minor misunderstandings get smoked out this way
* **Workbook**
  * A formal project workbook must be started at the beginning
  * *See below*

## The Project Workbook

* **What**
  * The project workbook isnt a separate document
    * Rather, it is a strucutre imposed on the documents that will already be produced
  * All of the documents of the project need to be part of this structure
    * Objectives, external specifications, interface specifications, technical standards, internal specifications, and administrative memoranda
* **Why**
  * Thoughful organization does wonders for helping explain a system
  * Furthermore it ensure all information can be easily dispersed to those in need
    * Up to date, and easily changable versions, must be readily available to all team members

## Organization in the Large Programming Project

* Communication has a lot of potential connections
  * (n^2 - n)/2
* "The man with strong management talent and string technical talent is rarely found. Thinkers are rare; doers are rarer; and thinker-doers are the rarest."
* The Producer is the boss
  * Allocates resources and delegates
* The Director holds all technical authority

  * Like the **Surgical Team**

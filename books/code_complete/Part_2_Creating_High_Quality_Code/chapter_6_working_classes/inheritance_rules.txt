- If multiple classes share common data but not behavior, create a
common object that those classes can contain

- If multiple classes share common behavior but not data, derive them
from a common base class that defines the common routines

- If multiple classes share common data and behavior, inherit from a
common base class that defines the common data and routines

- Inherit when you want the base class to control your interface;
contain when you want to control your interface

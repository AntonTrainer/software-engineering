# Requirements

#### Requirements are a detailed description of what the software system is supposed to do

"Requirements are like water. They're easier to build on when they're frozen"

## Why so important

* Without good requirements, you can have the right general problem, but miss the mark on specific aspects of the problem
* The deeper into the project life cycle, the cost to fix continues to grow
* Managing customer change requests is easier to handle with a documentation trail and words like **schedule** and **cost** can be utilized effectively
  * "Since its not in the requirements document, let me pull together a revised 'schedule' and 'cost' estimate so you can decide if you want to do it now or later"

## Checklists

# Prerequisites

**Overall, the prerequisites should turn over every stone in creating a simple explanation(architecture) to describe the system solution.**

## Prerequisites encompass the following disciplines

## Problem Definition

* Make sure you know what you’re aiming at before you shoot

## [Requirements](./requirements)

* A detailed description of what the software system is supposed to do

## [Architecture](./architecture)

* Design constraints that apply system wide

## General

### Time imprint

* Typically, for requirements, architecture, and upfront planning
  * 10-20% of effort
  * 20-30% for schedule

### The overarching goal of preparation is risk reduction

* Clearing out major risks as early as possible so the bulk of the project can proceed smoothly
* Most common project risks are poor requirements and poor project planning

### Plan for, require, and design a high-quality product

* If you want a Rolls-Royce, you need to plan to build one from the very beginning.

### Information consumption hierarchy

1. Architects consume the requirements
2. Designers consume the architecture
3. Coders consume the design

### Prerequisite Styles

#### Iterative – build things in iterations as requirements change

* Requirements are not well understood
* Design is complex, challenging, or both
* Development team is unfamiliar with applications area
* Project contains a lot of risk
* Long term predictability is not important
* Cost of changing reqs, design, and code downstream is low

#### Sequential – prerequisites need to be satisfied up front

* Requirements are stable
* Design is straightforward and fairly well understood
* Dev team is familiar with application area
* Project contains little risk
* Long term predictability is important
* Cost of changing reqs, resign, and code downstream is high.

### Properly interfacing with non-techs

* Need to educate them about the development process and why prerequisites are so important
* **Techniques**
  * Appeal to **logic**  
    * "We need to understand what to build so time and money isn’t spent building the wrong thing"
  * Appeal to **analogy**
    * "You don’t start a fire until opening the flue"
    * "You don’t put your shoes on before your socks"
  * Appeal to **data**
    * "Studies of the last 25 years have shown conclusively that it pays to do things right the first time"

# Architecture

#### Architecture is the design of constraints that apply system wide

"When you look at the architecture, you should be pleased by how natural and easayy the solution seems."

* The quality of the architecture determines the conceptual integrity of the system. This in turn determines the ultimate quality of the system.
* Without good software architecture, you may have the right problem but the wrong solution. It may be impossible to have successful construction.

## General Architectural Quality

* Good architecture specs are characterized by
  * Discussions of the classes in the system
  * Information hidden in each class
  * Rationales for including and excluding all possible design alternatives

## Architecture Components

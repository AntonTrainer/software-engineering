Key Points

- As project siz eincreases, communication needs to be supported. The 
    point of most methodologies is to reduce communications problems, 
    and a methodology should life or die on ite merits as a 
    communication facilitator
- All other things being equal, productivity will be lower on a large
    project than on a small one
- All other things being equal, a large project will have more errors
    per thousand lines of code than a small one
- Activityies that are taken for granted on small projects must be
    carefully planned on larger ones. Construction becomes less 
    predominant as a project size increases
- Scaling up a lightweight methodology tends to work better than
    scaling down a heavyweight methodology. The most effective 
    approach is to use a "rightweight" methodology

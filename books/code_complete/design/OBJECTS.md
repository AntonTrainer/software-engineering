# Objects

## Find real world object to model design after

* Like:
  * Employee
  * Timecard
  * Client
  * Bill
* Identify objects and their attributes
  * Methods and Data
* Determine what can be done to each object
* Determine what each object is allowed to **do to other objects**
* Determine which parts of the object will be **public vs private**
* Define each objects **public interface**

## Inheritance

### Only inherit when it simplifies the design

### Only inherit when objects are a lot like other objects

### Inherit when most data overlaps, but some is different

## Defect Detection Techniques

### [Reviews](./Code_Review.pdf)

* Design reviews
  * Informal
  * Formal inspections
* Code reviews
  * Informal
  * Formal inspections
* Desk-checking of code

### Modeling or prototyping

### [Testing](./Code_Testing.pdf)

* Unit tests
* New component testing
* Integration testing
* Regression testing
* System testing

### [Debugging](./Debugging.pdf)

### USE ALL OF THESE, DONE BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE

* Code reading also detects more errors than rigid testing

Key Points

- One of the primary goals of programming is managing complexity
- The programming process significantly affects the final product
- Team programming is more an exercise in communicating with people 
    than in communicating with a computer. Individual programming is
    more an exercise in communicating with yourself than a computer
- When abused, a programming convention can be a cure thats worse than
    the disease. Used thoughtfully, a convention adds valuable structure
    to the development environment and helps with managing complexity
    and communication
- Programming in terms of the problem rather than the solution helps to
    manage complexity
- Paying attention to intellectual warning signs like the "irritation
    of doubt" is especially important in programming because 
    programming is almost purely a mental activity
- The more you iterate in each development activity, the better the
    product of that activity will be
- Dogmatic methodologies and high-quality software development dont mix.
    Fill your intellectual toolbox with programming alternatives and
    improve your skill at chosing the right tool for the job

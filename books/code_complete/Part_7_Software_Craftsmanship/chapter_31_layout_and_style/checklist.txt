Key Points

- The first priority of visual layout is to illuminate the logical
    organization of the code. Criteria used to asses whether that
    priority is achieved include accuracy, consistency, readability
    and maintainability
- Looking good is secondary to the other criteris - a distant second.
    If the other criteria are met and the underlying code is good, 
    however, the layout will look fine
- Structuring code is important for its own sake. The specific
    convention you follow is less important than the fact that you 
    follow some convention consistently. A layout convention thats
    followed inconsistently can actually hurt readability
- Many aspects of layout are religious issues. Try to separate 
    objective preferences from subjective one. Use explicit criteria to
    help ground your discussions about style preferences

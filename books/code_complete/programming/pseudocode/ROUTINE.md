# Steps in Creating a Routine

* Check the reqs and make sure the routine is useful and dfined
* Define the problem it will solve
  * All the info the routine will hide
  * Inputs to the routine
  * Outputs from the routine
  * Preconditions that are guaranteed to be true before routine is called
  * Postconditions the routine guarantees before passing control back to caller
* Name the routine
* Decide how to test the routine
* **Research existing standard library function**
  * **Single best way to improve code and productivity is to reuse good code**
* Think about error handling
* Think about efficiency
  * Efficiency isnt critical, make sure routine interfaces are well abstracted and the code is readable
  * Main efficiency comes from high level decisions, not at the routine level
* Research algorithms and data types
  * Before writing complicated code from scratch - **just dont** - look it up

# Actually Coding the Routine

### 1) Write routine declaration

### 2) Write first and last statements

* Note all assumptions about the interface, in and out

### 3) Turn pseudocode into high level comments

### 4) Check the code

* Sometimes code below each comment line will explode
  * Option 1: factor new code into a new routine
  * Option 2: Apply PPP recursively

### 5) Clean up leftovers

* Check routine interface
  * make sure all I/O accounted
  * all parameters used
* Check for general design quality
  * make sure routine does only one thing and does it well
  * loosely coupled
* Check routine variables
  * inaccurate variable names
  * unused objects
  * etc
* Check routine statements and logic
* Check routines layout
  * correctly used whitespace to clarify logical structure
* Check routines documentation
  * Make sure pseudocode translated into comments is still accurate
  * Check for algorithm descriptions
  * Documentation on interface assumptions
  * Non-obvious dependencies
  * Justification of unclear coding practices
* Remove redundant comments
* **Repeat as needed**

# If-Else Conditionals

## Guidelines

### 1) Want the expected case to be the first if block

* Include an else clause too
  * 50-80% of if statements should have one
* Account for both cases in testing

### 2) Simplify complicated tests with boolean function calls

## Misc

* Main goal is to reduce complexity
* Phrase things positively
  * "I ain't not no undummy" - Homer Simpson
* Break complicated tests into partial tests
* Use literal `True` and `False` values instead of `1, 0`
* Control flow complexity is correlated with
  * Low reliability
  * Frequent errors

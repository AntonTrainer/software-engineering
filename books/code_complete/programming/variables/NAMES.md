# Naming Conventions

## Common Opposites

* Begin/end
* First/last
* Locked/unlocked
* Min/max
* Next/previous
* Old/new
* Opened/closed
* Visible/invisible
* Source/target
* Source/destination
* Up/down

## Informal Naming Conventions

### Guidelines

* Differentiate between variable names and routine names
  * well... PEP8 kindof doesnt work well for this
* Differentiate between classes and objects
  * Add specific name to the variable
  * `Widget employeeWidget`
  * There are other types, but all subpar
    * see full notes
* Lead with types too
  * `color_` or `planet_` style

### All that matters is you dont mix techniques

## Standard Prefixes

* ch = character in document
  * `chCursorPosition`
* doc = document
  * `docActive`
* pa = paragraph
  * `firstPaActiveDocument`
* scr = screen
  * `scrUserWorkspace`
* sel = selection
* wn = window
  * `wnMain`

# Programming

Programming encompasses implementing the designed solution via code

## Outlining and Setup

* ### [Pseudocode Programming Process](./pseudocode)

   **The point is to rise above the cycle of hacking something together and running to see if it works**

   "Compiling something before you're sure your program works is often a symptom of the hacker mindset"

  * [Pseudocode Checklist](./pseudocode/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

* ### [Program Organization](./organization)

## Code Blocks

* ### [Classes](./classes)

  "Classes are your primary tool for managing complexity"

  * [Classes checklist](./classes/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

* ### [Routines](./routines)

   Methods and procedures with a single purpose

  * [Routines checklist](./routines/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

* ### [Variables](./variables)

  * [Variables checklist](./variables/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

## Control Structures

* ### [If-Else Conditionals](./if_else)

* ### [Loops](./loops)

## Safety

* ### [Defensive Programming](./defensive_programming)

  **Take responsability for protecting yourself even when its the other drivers fault**

   "Defensive programming is about adopting the mindset that you have no idea what other drivers are going to do."

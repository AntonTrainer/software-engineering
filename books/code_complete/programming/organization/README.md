# Program Organization

## Goals:

### 1) Make code read from top to bottom

* Dont want to be jumping around

### 2) Group related statements

* By **operations** on the same data
* By performing **similar tasks**
* Depending on being performed **in order**

### 3) Able to draw boxes around related statements

* If done correctly, should be nested rectangles with none overlapping
* If there are overlaps, need to reorganize code

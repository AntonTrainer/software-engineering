# Appendix A: Rules

* The ScrumMaster is the one responsible for ensuring everyone knows the rules, as well as enforcing them
* Rule changes should originate from the Team, not management
* Rule changes should only be entertained if everyone involved exactly how Scrum works

## Sprint Planning Meeting

* Attendees:
  * ScrumMaster
  * Product Owner
  * Team
  * **NO CHICKENS**
* PO must perpare the Product Backlog prior to the meeting
  * If PO is unable to, the ScrumMaster needs to

### First Half

* Team selects items from Product Backlog they think they can committ to turning in
* PO has final say on what gets added to the Sprint

### Second Half

* PO needs to be around to answer questions
* Its up to the Team and only the Team to figure out how to turn the Product backlog into tasks for the Sprint
* Team creates the Sprint Backlog

## Daily Scrum Meeting

* Hold the Daily Scrum in the same place at the same time every work day
  * Do it first thing in the morning if possible
* All team members are required to come
* Team members must be on time (have to pay the ScrumMaster $1 if late)
* Each Team member should respond to 3 questions only
  * What have you done since the last Daily Scrum regarding this project?
  * What will you do between now and the next Daily Scrum meeting regarding this project?
  * What impedes you from performing your work as effectively as possible?
* Team members shouldnt talk about anything else whatsoever
* Chickens are not allowed to talk
* Chickens arent allowed to talk to the Team after the meeting
* Any Chicken or Pig that doesnt follow the rules needs to be banned from meetings or removed from the Team

## Sprint

* The Team can seek outside advice, help, info and support during the sprint
* No one can provide advice, instructions, commentary, or direction to the Team during the Sprint. The Team is utterly self managing
* The Team commits to Product Backlog during the Sprint planning meeting. No one is allowed to change this Product Backlog during the sprint. The Product Backlog is frozen until the end of the Sprint
* The Sprint can be terminated if the product proves unworkable. After termination, a new Sprint will need to be convened
* If the Team feels unable to complete all of the committed Product Backlog, it can consult with the PO on what to remove
  * More items can also be added
* The Team members have two administrative tasks
  * Show up to every Daily Scrum meeting
  * Keep the Sprint Backlog up-to-date and available in a public folder, visible to all

## Sprint Review Meeting

* The purpose of the Sprint review is for the Team to present to the PO the functionality that is done
* Functionality that isnt "Done" cannot be presented
* Sprint review starts with a Team member presenting the Sprint goal, the Product Backlog committed to, and the Product Backlog completed
  * Team members will then talk about what went well and what didnt in the Sprint
* The majority of the Sprint review is spent with the Team members presenting functionality, answering stakeholder questions and noting changes
  * **Be sure to lead with the easiest to grasp concepts**
  * Diagrams
  * Visual interfaces
  * CLI
  * Code (last resort)
* At the end, stakeholders are polled for impressions, changes, and priority of changes
* The PO discusses with stakeholders the best way to rearrange the Product Backlog

## Sprint Retrospective Meeting

* Attended only by:
  * The Team
  * ScrumMaster
  * PO (optional)
* Start the meeting by having all Team members answer:
  * What went well during the last Sprint?
  * What could be improved in the next Sprint?
    * The ScrumMaster notes the improvements
    * The Team prioritizes improvements
* The Team talks about improvements, and the ScrumMaster is not allowed to provide answers
* Actionable items that can be added to the next Sprint should be considered high-priority nonfunctional Product Backlog
  * Retrospectives that dont result in change are sterile and frustrating

# Chapter 3: The ScrumMaster

"Chickens must be kept in line"

"If the ScrumMaster is unclear about whats going on, so is everyone else"

## General

* Learning the practices and rules is easy
* Learning how to effectively convey and manage is difficult
* **Is imperative that the ScrumMaster does not tell people what work to do**
  * I would compare the the ScrumMaster to a sheepdog who would do anything to protect its flock"
  * The ScrumMaster is not a sheep so they don't tell them how to eat grass haha
  * Missing Scrum meetings or leaving early tell the team that the project is less important than the other thing - BAD!
* **Don't be afraid to promote protective people to fill the ScrumMaster role if the standing ScrumMaster forgets their role**
* "What does that hae to do with code?"

## Summary of Responsibilities

* Remove the barriers between development and the Product Owner so that the Product Owner directly drives development
* Teach the Product Owner how to maximize ROI and meet their objectives through Scrum
* Improve the lives of the development team by fascilitating creativity and empowerment
* Improve the productivity of the development team in any way possible
* Improve the engineering practices and tools so that each increment of functionality is potentially shippable
* Keep information about the teams progress up-to-date and visible to all parties

### If done correctly, these responsibilites should be enough to keep the ScrumMaster too busy to be a typical boss

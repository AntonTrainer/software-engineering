# Chapter 7: Project Reporting - Keeping Everything Visible

Scrum projects are controlled by means of frequent inspection of the project followed by necessary adaptions.

## Report Types

1) The Product Backlog at the start of the **previous** Sprint
2) The Product Backlog at the start of the **new** Sprint
3) The `Changes Report` - detailing all the differences in previous Product Backlogs
4) The `Burndown Report`

### The Changes Report

* Summarizes:
  * What happened during the Sprint
  * What was seen at the Sprint review
  * What adaptations have been made to the project in response to the `inspection` at Sprint review

#### Questions

* Why have future Sprints been reformulated?
* Why did the team complete fewer requirements than anticipated during the Sprint?
* Where was the incomplete work reprioritized in the Product Backlog?
* Was the team more or less productive than it had anticipated?

# Chapter 1: Backdrop - The Science of Scrum

"This book is about the ScrumMaster, the project manager who heads the scrum project"

* Provide leadership, guidance, coaching
* Teach others how to use the Scrum process

## Empirical Process Control

**Empirical:** based on observation or experiment

* As opposed to defined process control, which is a process that repeatably will produce acceptable quality output

### Three legs

* Visibility
  * The aspects of the process that affect the outcome MUST be visible to those controlling the process
  * Critical that what is visible is true:
    * **There is ZERO margin for falsely labeled "Done" tasks**
    * Fallacies like this imply:
      * Clean code
      * Well refactored
      * Unit-tested
      * Built
      * Acceptance-tested
* Inspection
  * Aspects of the process must be inspected frequently enough that unacceptable variances in the process can be detected
* Adaption
  * If, through inspection, an aspect of the process are outside the limits, the inspector must adjust the process or the material being processed
  * These adjustments must be made as quickly as possible to minimize further deviation

## The Skeleton and Heart of Scrum

* Team members get together and review each others activities every 24 hours

### How Skeletons Operate

* At start of an `iteration,` the team reviews what it must do
  * It selects what it believes it can turn into an increment of potentially shipable functionality by the end of the iteration
* The team is left alone to do its work
* At the end of the iteration, the team presents the increment of functionality
  * This functionality is inspected and timely adaptions can be made

### "Heart of Scrum"

* The team
  * Takes a look at requirements
  * Considers available technology
  * Evaluates its own skills and capabilities
* Then, collectively
  * Determines how to build the functionality
  * Modify the approach daily as difficulties are encountered
  * Determines what needs to be done and selects the best way to do it

`See Appendix A, B, and C for Scrum specific tools`

## Scrum Roles

### Three Roles

* Product Owner
* The Team
* ScrumMaster

### Product Owner

* Represents the interests of everyone with a stake in the project and its resulting system
* Achieves initial and ongoing funding by
  * Creating the projects initial overall requirements
  * Return on Investment (ROI) objectives
  * Release plans
* The list of requirements becomes the `backlog`
  * PO is responsible for using the `Product Backlog` to ensure that the most valuable functionality is produced first and built upon
  * This is achieved by prioritizing the backlog to queue up the most valuable requirements for the next iteration

### The Team

* Responsible for developing functionality
* Self managing and organizing
* Figure out how to turn a backlog into an increment of functionality

### ScrumMaster

* Responsible for the Scrum process
* Teaches Scrum to everyone involved with the project
* Implementing Scrum so that it fits within an organizations culture
* Ensures everyone follows Scrum rules and practices

### Pigs and Chickens

* People that fill the above roles are heavily committed to the project
* Other people may be interested in the project, but arent on the hook
* Scrum makes a clear distinction between these people, and ensure that those responsible for the project have full authority to do what it takes to be successful

`A chicken and a pig are walking down the road. The chicken says to the pig, "Do you want to open a restaurant with me?" The pig considers the question and replies, "Yes, I'd like that. What do you want to call the restauraunt?" The chicken replies, "Ham and Eggs!" The pig stops, pauses, and replies, "On second thought, I don't think I want to open a restaurant with you. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved."`

## Scrum Flow

### Start

* Scrum project start with a vision of the system to be developed
  * The PO is repsonsible for finding funding and delivering the vision in a manner that maximizes ROI
  * The PO formulates a plan for doing so, and places the plan in the Product Backlog
  * The `Product Backlog` is a list of functional and nonfunctional requirements

### Sprints

* `Sprints` are initiated with a Sprint planning meeting
  * PO and Team get together to collaborate about what will be done for the next Sprint
* First part of the meeting
  * Spent with the PO
  * PO presents the highest priority Product Backlog to the Team
  * The Team questions them about the
    * Content
    * Purpose
    * Meaning
    * Intentions
  * After The Team knows enough, they select as much of the Product Backlog that it believes it can complete to functionality
  * The Team commits to the PO that it will do its best
    * **AKA NO ADDED FUNCTIONALITY DURING SPRINTS**
* Second part of meeting
  * The Team plans out the sprint
  * First, a tenative plan is created
  * The tasks that compose the plan are put into the `Sprint Backlog`
    * More and more tasks are added to the Sprint Backlog as the sprint progesses
    * **This is CRITICAL: Sprint Backlogs are TASKS - not functionality**
* Sprints are kept short to ensure the customer doesnt lose interest

### Daily Scrum

* **15 Minute** Meeting daily
* Purpose is to synchronize the work of all Team members daily and to schedule any meetings that the Team needs to forward its progress

#### Three Questions

* What have you done on this project since the last Daily Scrum meeting?
* What do you plan on doing this project between now and the next Daily Scrum meeting?
* What impediments stand in the way of you meeting your commitments to this Sprint and this project?

### Sprint Review

* At the end of the Sprint, a `Sprint review` meeting is held
* The Team presents what was developed to the Product Owner
  * Other stakeholders can attend
* **Informal meeting** meant to present functionality and help determine what to do next

### Sprint Retrospective

* After the Sprint review, a `Sprint retrospective`
* This is for the Team to revise processes and practices to make development for effective and enjoyable

## Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog

* The requirements for the system being developed
* The Product Owner is responsible for the contents, prioritization and availability
* The Product Backlog is never complete, and is always changing
* Should include:
  * Functional requirements
  * Non functional requirements (project scaffolding)

`Burndown Charts` are useful for showing the amount of work remaining across time

### Sprint Backlog

* Defines the work, or tasks, that a Team decides to work on in a sprint
* **Tasks should be divided into items that take 4-16 hours**

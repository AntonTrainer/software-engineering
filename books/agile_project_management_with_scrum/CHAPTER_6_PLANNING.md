# Chapter 6: Planning a Scrum Project

## Overview

* Goal is to synchronize stakeholder and team expections

### Three Questions

* What can those funding the project expect to have changed when the project is finished?
* What progress will have been made by the end of each Sprint?
* Why should those being asked to fund the project believe that the project is a valuable investment, and why should they believe that those proposing the project can deliver those predicted benefits?

## Minimum Plan

### Vision

  * Why the project is being undertaken
  * What the desired end state is

### Product Backlog

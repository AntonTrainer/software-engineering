# Agile Project Management with Scrum

## Why Scrum Works

* "As complexity increases, central control and dispatching systems break down"
* "The people who prevail are those who figure out how to change to a system of independent agents operating under and appropriate set of rules"
* Think like a government doing deregulation

## Introduction

* Scrum is a framework and set of practices that keep everything visible

### Only COMPLETED work is acceptable

### Fundamental Scrum Rule: The team is left alone during the Sprint to accompish the goals it has committed to

### Teams cannot feel like they are doing the bidding of someone else - progress must be organic to reach the objectives

* Getting overruled on a design decision is the most deflating thing ever

### As incremental functionality is developed, it is tested. This results in less debugging down the line, away from when the original code was written

### The Team must do its best every sprint, and use shortcomings or overestimates to adjust estimates of the next sprint

### Every increment of functionality must be completely 100% buttoned up and ready to ship - a complete product

* Contains all
  * Analysis
  * Design
  * Coding
  * Testing
  * Documentation
* **When a stakeholder sees a working piece of software, they can assume it is complete**
  * Until then - dont show functionality!

### Not keeping the sprint backlog up to date is a huge red flag that code is being hacked together

* When hacking, teams dont spend much time on analysis, design and testing

### If the ScrumMaster is unclear on whats going on, so is everyone else

* Reports have different [questions](./CHAPTER_7####Questions) to answer

# Chapter 9: Scaling Projects Using Scrum

* aka: How to complete projects that are too big to be done by one team
* When more than one Scrum team works simultaneously on a project, it is called a `scaling project`
* The mechanisms used to coordinate teams are called `scaling mechanisms`

## General Principles

* Build the infrastructure to scale before scaling
* Always deliver business value while building the infrastructure
* Optimize the capabilities of the initial team
  * Then staff additional teams with at least one member from the original team

## Scrum Scaling

* Prior to scaling, must stand up necessary infrastructure
  * If multiple teams are spread out, need a mechanism for frequently synchronizing their work must be devised and implemented.
  * Detailed architecture must be created so work can be cleanly divided
* Scaling planning must be done within sprints too
* Must be sure to deliver business functionality as well
  * Demonstrate how the scaling solutions work
* Non-functional requirements have top priority
* Note:
  * Only one team can Sprint until the scaling infrastructure is in place
  * Until in place, there is no mechanism for coordinating multiple teams

## Staging

* `Staging` is the process of defining and prioritizing the nonfunctional requirements neccesary to scale
* Takes place prior to the start of the first Sprint and takes just one day
  * On this day the Product Backlog is populated

## Misc

* Create hierarchies of product backlogs

# DevOps Handbook

* Be sure to look into infrastructure as code

## The Problem

**Something in your organization must need improvement (or you wouldnt be reading this book)** (lmao)

### The core, chronic conflict

This lies at the interface between developement and operations - the guys actually deploying things

* `technical debt` describes how decisions we make lead to problems that get increasingly more difficult to fix over time
  * This in turn reduces available options in the future

# Two Main Goals

1. **Respond to the rapidly changing competitive landscape**
2. **Provide stable, reliable, and secure service to the customer**

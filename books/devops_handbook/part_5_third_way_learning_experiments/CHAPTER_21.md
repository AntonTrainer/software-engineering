# Chapter 21: Reserve Time to Create Organizational Learning and Improvement

Bro! Target does 2-day sprints in their DevOps Dojo - weeklong sprints are fine!

## Institutionalize Rituals to Pay Down Technical Debt

* Schedule and conduce daylong or weeklong improvement blitzes where not new features can be added
* Use hackathons to creatively prototype new functionality
  * Needs to be very free flow

## Enable Everyone to Teach and Learn

* Let people teach and learn about whatever they want
* Make this a regular thing too
* If people arent jumping up and down to share what theyve learned:
  * Theyre probably not learning
    * Probably because theyre swamped
  * Or the culture is not open to new ideas

## Share Your Experiences from Devops Conferences

* Internal conferences where org teams show their products like vendors is cool

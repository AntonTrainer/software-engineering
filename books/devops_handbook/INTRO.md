# DevOps Intro

## The Problem

**Something in your organization must need improvement (or you wouldnt be reading this book)** (lmao)

### The core, chronic conflict

This lies at the interface between developement and operations - the guys actually deploying things

* `technical debt` describes how decisions we make lead to problems that get increasingly more difficult to fix over time
  * This in turn reduces available options in the future

## Two Main Goals

1. **Respond to the rapidly changing competitive landscape**
2. **Provide stable, reliable, and secure service to the customer**

* "The core, chronic conflict" is that developers and operations people have such different roles that their goals arent in line, and the two groups actually are working towards different things

## Downward Spiral in Three Acts

### 1) IT Operations

* Goal is to keep applications and infrastructure running
* Problems are mostly due to apps and infrastructure that are:
  * Complex
  * Poorly documented
  * Incredibly fragile
* Always promising to fix the mess, but the time never comes
* Typically, the most fragile artifacts support the most important systems

### 2) Business compensation -> Developer workload

* After the latest broken promise, a product manager must compensate
* This typically takes the form of promising a bigger and bolder new feature
  * Revenue targets
* This leads to even more pressure on the Developement team
  * This results in more cut corners and more technical debt

### 3) Final Act

* Everything becomes just a little more difficult
  * Everyone gets a little busier
  * Work takes a little more time
  * Communication is slower
  * Work queues get a little longer
* Smaller actions cause bigger failures
* We become fearful and intolerant of change

"Every company is a technology company regardless of what business they think theyre in. A bank is just an IT company with a banking license"

## The Costs: Human and Economic

* When people are trappeed in systems that pre-ordain failure, people burnout and dispair
  * This can result in a condition called *learned helplessnes*
    * People become unwilling and unable to act in a way that avoids the same problem in the future
    * (Sounds like some people you know... lmao)
  * The best people will leave (or stay because of duty or obligation - dont be one of these people)

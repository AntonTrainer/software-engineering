# Chapter 4: The Third Way: The Principles of Continual Learning and Experimentation

Tight swirles represeting continual learning and experimentation

* Turn `individual knowledge`
  * Into `team knowledge`
    * Into `organizational knowledge`
* Need to reinforce a `high trust culture` that encourages `risk taking` to the end of continually learning and improving

## Enabling Organizational Learning and a Safety Culture

* Seek to **understand why** accident happened, not find blame

### Three Types of Culture

* **Pathological organizations** are characterized by large amounts of fear and threat.
  * People horde information, withhold it for political reasons, or distort it to make themselves look better
  * Failure is often hidden
* **Bureaucratic organization** are characterized by rules and processes, often to help individual departments maintain their "turf"
  * Failure is processed through a system of judgement, resulting in either punishment or justice and mercy
* **Generative organizations** are characterized by actively seeking and sharing information to better enable the organization to achieve its mission
  * Responsibilities are shared through the value stream
  * Failure results in reflection and genuine inquery

| **Pathological** | **Bureaucratic** | **Generative** |
|-|-|-|
| Information is hidden | Information may be ignored | Information is actively sought |
| Messengers are "shot" | Messengers are tolerated | Messengers are trained |
| Responsibilities are shirked | Responsibilities are compartmented | Responsibilities are shared |
| Bridging between teams is discouraged | Bridging between teams is allowed but discouraged | Bridging between teams is rewarded |
| Failure is covered up | Organization is just an merciful | Failure causes inquiry |
| New ideas are crushed | New ideas create problems | New ideas are welcomed |

"By removing blame, you remove fear; by removing fear, you enable honestly; and honesty enables prevention"

## Institutionalize the Improvement of Daily Work

* If things are not bring improved, they dont stay the same, they actually degrade over time
  * Use `kaizen blitzes` to get the whole team free from actual work to improve whatever they want
    * In between sprints?
    * In between milestones?

## Transform Local Discoveries into Global Improvements

* US Navy Nuclear Power Propultion Program has **5,700** reactor years of operation without a reactor related casualty or escape of radiation
* A huge backbone of this is a single central knowledge base that everyone has access to
  * Constantly Codify
  * Constantly Proceduralize

## Inject Resilience Patterns Into Daily Work

* If you have two mfct lines, and on a slow day, send all work to one line and experiment on the other
  * Need exceptional test environments
* Chaos Monkey

## Leaders Reinforce a Learning Culture

* Primary goal is to create conditions so their team can discover greatness in daily work

### Leadership Experiment Coaching Questions

* What was your last step and what happened?
* What did you learn?
* What is your condition now?
* What is your next target condition?
* What obstacle are you working on now?
* What is your next step?
* What is your expected outcome?
* When can we check?

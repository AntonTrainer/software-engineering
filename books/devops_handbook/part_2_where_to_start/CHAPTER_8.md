# Chapter 8: How to Get Great Outcomes by Integrating Operations into the Daily Work of Development

Main goal: enable market oriented outcomes where many small teams can quickly and independently deliver value to the customer

## Main stretegies

* Create self service capabilities to enable developers in the service teams to be productive
* Embed Ops engineers into the service teams
* Assign Ops liasions to the service teams when embedding Ops is not possible

## Create Shared Services to Increase Developer Productivity

* Some Tools include
  * Production-like environments
  * Deployment pipelines
  * Automated testing tools
  * Production telemetry dashboards
* All of these should be available without requiring opening up a ticket to gain access
* Treat delivering these values like a real Product - because it it, just internally

## Embed Ops Engineers Into our Service Teams

* Reduce reliance on centralized Operations
* By embedding, the Ops engineers become entirely focused on solving the teams problems
  * NOT solving the Ops Centers problems internally
* "Use the Ops engineers to lay the tracks and build the bridges, not just drive the train"

## Assign an Ops Liasion to Each Service Team

* Still reliant on centralized Ops to run and maintain encironments
* Designated Ops Engeers are reponsible for understanding:
  * What the new product functionality is and why were building it
  * How it works as it pertains to operability, scalability, and observability (diagramming is strongly encouraged)
  * How to monitor and collect metrics to ensure the progress, success, or failure of the functionality
  * Any departures from previous architectures and patterns and the justification for them
  * Any extra needs for infrastructure and how usage will affect infrastructure capacity
  * Feature launch plans

## Integrate Ops Into Dev Rituals

* Teaching Agile ways to Ops people is yuuge
* Invite Ops to our dev standups
* Invite Ops to our dev retrospectives
  * Gives great feedback
  * Helps improve planning in the future
* Make relevant Ops work visible on shared Kanban boards
  * Good for making sure Dev knows what Ops is going through before it becomes an "oh shit"
  * Ensures visibility on prioritization as well

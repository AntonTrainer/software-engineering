# Chapter 5: Selecting Which Value Stream to Start With

## Greenfield vs Brownfield Services

* Greenfield = undeveloped land
* Brownfield = land previously used for industrial purposes
  * (Potentially contaminated with hazardous waste or pollution)
* The rpimary predictor of performance is whether the system was architected (or could be architected) for testability and deployability

## Consider Both Systems of Record and Systems of Engagement

* Systems of record = correctness of transactions are paramount (medical, financial)
  * Slower and typically regulated
  * More of a focus on "doing it right"
* Systems of engagement = customer and user facing applications
  * Faster and higher rate of change
  * Rapid feedback loops focus on "doing it fast"

## Start with the Most Sympathetic and Innovative Groups

* Apply lots of pressure and attention on the areas (and groups) most likely to budge
* **Not super fruitful to change the mind of people whose minds dont want to be changed**

## Expanding DevOps Across Our Organization

* Demonstrate early wins
* Broadcast successes

### Typical Phases

* Find Innovators and Early Adopters
  * Ideally, people who are respected and have a high degree of influence over the rest of the org
  * Need to build credibility
* Build Critical Mass and Silent Majority
  * Need stable base of support
  * Can start working with less visible and influental folks
  * Want to instigate a "bandwagon effect"
  * Deliberately avoid dangerous political battles that could jeopardize the initiative
* Identify the Holdouts
  * "holdouts" are the high profile, influential detractors who will likely resit (or sabotage) efforts

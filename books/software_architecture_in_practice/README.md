# Software Architecture in Practice

## Part 1: Introduction

### [Chapter 1: What Is Software Architecture](./CHAPTER_1.md)

* The [Rules of Thumb](./RULES_OF_THUMB.md) are soo good
* [Architecture Structures Table](./ARCHITECTURE_STRUCTURES_TABLE.md)

### [Chapter 2: Why Is Software Architecture Important](./CHAPTER_2.md)

"The earlier you can find a problem in your design, the cheaper, easier, and less disruptive it will be to fix"

* Early ripples can become tsunamis
  * Be thoughtful about decisions and assumptions made early on
* Spend extensive time researching before deciding on an architecture
  * Changes are very costly
* Archtiecture and associated metrics for patterns are huge in helping managers allocate resources
  * A consensus between top-down estimates (from architects and PMs) and bottom-up estimates (created by developers) is great

## [Chapter 3: The Many Contexts of Software Architecture](./CHAPTER_3.md)

### See [Quality Attributes](./QUALITY_ATTRIBUTES.md)

"Functionality is not a driver of the architecture as much as it is a consequence of it"

## [Chapter 18: Documenting Software Architectures](./part_3_lifecycle/DOCUMENTING.md)

"If it is not written down, it does not exist"

* If an architecture is not documented, the system is essentially useless and will be subject to illinformed modifications and bastardizations of use
* All the hard work will have been wasted
* Also critical for noting the why behind things
  * Shmucks and jerks!
* Be sure to document decisions as well
* **Follow a release strategy**
  * This will greatly help with documentation

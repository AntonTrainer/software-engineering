"Just enough architecture" - the whole point is to reduce risk

## 15.2 Agility and Architecture Methods

### Architecture Documentation and YAGNI

#### YAGNI: "you aint gonna need"

* Only document what counts haha

## 15.3 A Brief Example of Agile Architecting

## 15.4 Guidelines for the Agile Architect

Want a balance between agility and committment

1. Committment accountability for success-critical stakeholders
2. Stakeholder "satisficing" (suffice - acceptability threshold) based on success-based negotiations and tradeoffs
3. Incremental and evolutionary growth of system definition and stakeholder committment
4. Iterative system development and defintion
5. Interleaved system definition and development allowing: early fielding of core capabilities, continual adaption to change, timely growth of systems unbound by every requirement
6. Risk management - risk-driven anchor point milestones, which become the key to synchronizing and stabilizing concurrent activities

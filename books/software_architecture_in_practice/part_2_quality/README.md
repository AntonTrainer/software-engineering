# Part 2: Quality Attributes

## [Chapter 4: Understanding Quality Attributes](./CHAPTER_4.md)

"Functionality often takes the front seat in the development scheme. This preference is often shortsighted, howver. Systems are frequently redesigned not because they are functionally deficient - the replacements are often functionally identical - but because they are difficult to maintina, port, or scale; or are too slow; or they have been compromised by hackers"

* A Quality Attribute is a measurable or testable property of a system used to indicate how well the system satisfies the needs of its stakeholders

## [Chapter 5: Availability](./CHAPTER_5.md)

"Its tempting to say that failure is not an option. Its a catchy phrase, but its a lousy design philosophy"

### [See Availability Table](./AVAILABILITY.md)

### Availability Tactics

1. [Fault Detection](./FAULT_DETECTION.md)
2. [Fault Recovery](./FAULT_RECOVERY.md)
3. [Fault Prevention](./FAULT_PREVENTION.md)

## [Chapter 6: Interoperability](./CHAPTER_6.md)

Interoperability is the degree to which two or more systems can usefull exchange meaningful information via interfaces in a particular context

* Basically, use SOAP or REST and WS* for interface boundaries

## [Chapter 7: Modifiability](./CHAPTER_7.md)

"Study after study shows that most of the cost of a typical software system occurs after it has been initially released"

## [Chapter 8: Performance](./CHAPTER_8.md)

## [Chapter 9: Security](./CHAPTER_9.md)

## [Chapter 10: Testability](./CHAPTER_10.md)

"Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding" - the leading to failure is why its so hard to rally to test, and why its so critical

## [Chapter 11: Usability](./CHAPTER_11.md)

"Any darn fool can make something complex; it takes a genius to make something simple" - Einstein

## [Chapter 12: Other Quality Attributes](./CHAPTER_12.md)

## [Chapter 13: Architectural Tactics and Patterns](./architecture_patterns)

## [Chapter 14: Quality Attribute Modeling and Analysis](./CHAPTER_14.md)

* Architectural patterns let you predict quality attributes
* Many times, this can be done with general equations for latency, queueing and availability

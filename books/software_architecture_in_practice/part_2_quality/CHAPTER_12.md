# Chapter 12: Other Quality Attributes

The "B list" of quality attributes

## 12.1 Other Important Quality Attributes

### Variability

* Variability is a special form of modifiability
* Uhhh like being able to make variations easily
  * Planning to make variations without requiring much modification
* Specifically in the context of a product line

### Portability

* Ease at which a system can be run on a different platform

### Development Distributability

* Ability for a system to be developed by teams all over

### Scalability

* Horizontal Scaling
  * Adding more logical units
  * Clusters
* Vertical Scaling
  * Adding more resources to one unit

### Deployability

* How an executable program arrives on a host platform and how it is subsequently invoked
  * How does it arrive
  * How is it integrated

### Mobility

* Deals with the movement and affordances of a platform
  * Size, display type, input devices, availability and volume of bandwidth

### Monitorability

* Ability to monitor a system while its executing
  * Metrics lieke transaction time, health of components, queue lengths

### Safety

## 12.2 Other Categories of Quality Attributes

### Conceptual Integrity of the Architecture

* High level integrity, but also low level integrity
  * Ensuring messages are passed the same way
  * Boilerplate data structures and stuff like that
  * Minimizing intellectual overhead

### Quality in Use

* Effectiveness
  * A measure of whether the system is correct
* Efficiency
  * The effort and time required to develop a system
  * What is the architectures impact on the projects cost and schedule?
* Freedom from risk
  * How the system might affect economic status, human life, health or the environment

### Marketability

* Some systems are well known by their architectures
* The architectures themselves carry a meaning all on their own, regardless of other quality attributes

## 12.3 Software Quality Attributes and System Quality Attributes

## 12.4 Using Standard Lists of Quality Attributes - or Not

Theres are [plenty of attributes](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010) to choose from

* Functional Suitability
  * Degree to which a product or system provides desired functions
* Performance Efficiency
  * Performance relative to the amount of resources available
* Compatability
  * Degree to which a system can exchange information
* Usability
  * How well a system can be used
* Reliability
* Security
* Maintainability
* Portability

### Sometimes, lists like these are good, but othertimes they introduce complexity and confusion

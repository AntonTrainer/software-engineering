# Analytics Models

| Quality Attribute | Intellectual Basis | Maturity/Gaps |
| - | - | - |
| Availability | Makarov models; statistical models | Moderate maturity; more reliable for hardware than software |
| Interoperability | Conceptual Framework | Low maturity; models require lots of human input and interpretation |
| Modifiability | Coupling and Cohesion metrics; cost models | Substantial research in academia; requires more empirical support in the real world |
| Performance | Queuing theory; real-time scheduling theory | High maturity; requires considerable education and training to use tho |
| Security | No architectural models |  |
| Testability | Component interaction metrics | Low maturity; little empirical validation |
| Usability | No architectural models |  |

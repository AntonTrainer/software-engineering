# Chapter 7: Before the Project

## 36) The Requirements Pit

"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away..."

### *Tip 51:* Dont gather requirements - dig for them

### Digging for Requirements

* Most requirements are not easily available on the surface
  * Question everything
* Important to understand the *why* behind a particular thing

### *Tip 52:* Work with a user to think like a user

### Documenting Requirements

#### Cockburns Use Case Template

* CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION
  * Goal in context
  * Scope
  * Level
  * Preconditions
  * Success end condition
  * Failed end condition
  * Primary actor
  * Trigger
* MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO
* EXTENSIONS
* VARIATIONS
* RELATED INFORMATION
  * Priority
  * Performance target
  * Frequency
  * Superordinate use case
  * Subordinate use case
  * Channel to primary actor
  * Secondary actors
  * Channel to secondary actors
* SCHEDULE
* OPEN ISSUES

### Overspecifying

* Dont want to be overspecific
  * Can cramp things
  * Better to have good level of abstractions

### *Tip 53:* Abstractions live longer than details

### Just One More Wafer-Thin Mint

* Many project failures are blamed on an increase in scope
* Also known as feature bloat
* Track feature requirements
  * Just like code source control

## 37) Solving Impossible Puzzles

### *Tip 55:* Dont think outside of the box - find the box

* Understanding "constraints" and how to exploit them is useful

### Impossible problems

* Is there an easier way?
* Are you trying to solve the right problem, or have you been distracted by a peripheral technicality?
* Why is this thing a problem?
* What is it thats making it so hard to solve?
* Does it have to be done this way?
* Does it have to be done at all?

## 38) Not Until Youre Ready

"He who hesitates is sometimes saved"

### *Tip 56:* Listen to nagging doubts - start when youre ready

### Good Judgement or Procrastination

* Prototype things just to get the juices flowing yknow?
* Flush out your concerns

## 39) The Specification Trap

* Program specification is the process of taking a requirement and reducing it down to the point where a programmers skill can take over
* Dont want to go so far as to rob the programmer of all creativity

### *Tip 57:* Some things are better done than described

## 40) Circles and Arrows

### *Tip 58:* Dont be a slave to formal methods

### *Tip 59:* Expensive tools do not produce better designs

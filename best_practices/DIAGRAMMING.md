# Diagramming Best Practices

## Lines

* `pt 3` line size when lines (communication paths) are the primary feature
* `pt 2` when lines just enable other symbols (and symbols are the primary feature)

## Grid Spacing

* `1 grid` buffer inside container spacing from the edge
* `1 grid` buffer between lines (but prefer strait lines over this spacing)
* `2 grid` buffer between elements adjacent to containers

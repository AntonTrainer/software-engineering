# Programming

Programming encompasses implementing the designed solution via code

## [Classes](./classes/README.md)

"Classes are your primary tool for managing complexity"

## [Routines](./routines/README.md)

Methods and procedures with a single purpose

## [Defensive Programming](./defensive_programming/README.md)

**Take responsability for protecting yourself even when its the other drivers fault**

"Defensive programming is about adopting the mindset that you have no idea what other drivers are going to do."

## [Pseudocode Programming Process](./pseudocode/readme.md)

"Compiling something before you're sure your program works is often a symptom of the hacker mindset"

#### The point is to rise above the cycle of hacking something together and running to see if it works

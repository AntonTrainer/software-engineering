# Steps in Creating a Class

* Create general design for the class
  * Design specific responsabilities
  * Define "secrets"
  * Determine if to derive from another class
    * Or if another class will be derived from it
  * Identify key public methods
  * Iterate through all these steps
* Construct each routine within the class
  * Determine major routines, then create them
  * This usually unearths more routines that need to be made
* Review and test the class as a whole
  * Test each routine
  * Test whole class as stand alone unit

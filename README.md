Trying to get good enough to be able to contribute to open source projects

## [**Prerequisites**](./PREREQUISITES.md)

**The prerequisites should turn over every stone in creating a simple explanation(architecture) to describe the system solution.**

### [**0 - Requirements**](./requirements/README.md)

#### Requirements are a detailed description of what the software system is supposed to do

"Requirements are like water. They're easier to build on when they're frozen"

* [Requirements checklist](./requirements/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

### [**1 - Architecture**](./architecture/README.md)

#### Architecture is the design of constraints that apply system wide

"When you look at the architecture, you should be pleased by how natural and easayy the solution seems."

* [Architecture checklist](./architecture/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

## Coding

### [**2 - Design**](./design/README.md)

#### Design is the process of compartmentalizing the system into packages/subsystems, classes, and routines while keeping complexity to an absolute minimum

"Once you understand that all other technical goals in software are secondary to managing complexity, many design considerations become straightforward"

* [Design checklist](./design/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

### [**3 - Programming**](./programming/README.md)

### [**Classes**](./programming/classes/README.md)

"Classes are your primary tool for managing complexity"

* [Classes checklist](./programming/classes/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

### [**Routines**](./programming/routines/README.md)

Methods and procedures with a single purpose

* [Routines checklist](./programming/routines/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

### [Defensive Programming](./programming/defensive_programming/README.md)

#### Take responsability for protecting yourself even when its the other drivers fault

"Defensive programming is about adopting the mindset that you have no idea what other drivers are going to do."

* [Defensive Programming checklist](./programming/defensive_programming/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

### [Pseudocode Programming Process](./programming/pseudocode/README.md)

#### The point is to rise above the cycle of hacking something together and running to see if it works

"Compiling something before you're sure your program works is often a symptom of the hacker mindset"

* [Pseudocode Checklist](./programming/pseudocode/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

## [**Postrequisites**](../idk.yet)

### [**4 - Quality Assurance**](./quality_assurance/README.md)

**Quality assurance sentence**
"Quality assurance quote"

### [**5 - Maintanence**](./maintanence/README.md)

**Maintanence sentence**

Trying to get good enough to be able to contribute to open source projects

## [**Prerequisites**](./PREREQUISITES.md)

* **Overall, the prerequisites should turn over every stone in creating a simple explanation(architecture) to describe the system solution.**

### [**0 - Requirements**](./requirements/README.md)

* **Requirements are a detailed description of what the software system is supposed to do**
* "Requirements are like water. They're easier to build on when they're frozen"
* [Requirements checklist](./requirements/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

### [**1 - Architecture**](./architecture/README.md)

* **Architecture is the design of constraints that apply system wide**
* "When you look at the architecture, you should be pleased by how natural and easayy the solution seems."
* [Architecture checklist](./architecture/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

## [Coding](../idk.yet)

### [**2 - Design**](./design/README.md)

* **Design is the process of compartmentalizing the system into packages/subsystems, classes, and routines while keeping complexity to an absolute minimum**
* "Once you understand that all other technical goals in software are secondary to managing complexity, many design considerations become straightforward"

### [**3 - Programming**](./programming/README.md)

* **Programming sentence**
* "Programming quote"

## [**Postrequisites**](../idk.yet)

### [**4 - Quality Assurance**](./quality_assurance/README.md)

* **Quality assurance sentence**
* "Quality assurance quote"

### [**5 - Maintanence**](./maintanence/README.md)

* **Maintanence sentence**
* "Maintanence quote"

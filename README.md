Notes on best practices, design patterns and useful tools

## Best Practices

* [Programming Best Practices](./best_practices/PROGRAMMING.md)
* [IDE Best Practices](./best_practices/IDEs.md)

## Requirements

"Requirements are like water. They're easier to build on when they're frozen"

* [Code Complete Requirements](./books/code_complete/prereqs/requirements)
* [The Pragmatic Programmer Requirements](./books/pragmatic_programmer/CHAPTER_7.md)

## Architecture

**Architecture is the design of constraints that apply system wide**

"When you look at the architecture, you should be pleased by how natural and easayy the solution seems."

* [Software Architecture in Practice](./books/software_architecture_in_practice)
* [Code Complete Architecture](./books/code_complete/prereqs/architecture)

## Design

**Design is the process of compartmentalizing the system into packages/subsystems, classes, and routines while keeping complexity to an absolute minimum**

"Once you understand that all other technical goals in software are secondary to managing complexity, many design considerations become straightforward"

* [Code Complete Design](./books/code_complete/design)
* [Design Patterns](./books/design_patterns)

## Programming

* [Code Complete Programming](./books/code_complete/programming)
* [The Pragmatic Programmer](./books/pragmatic_programmer)

## Quality Assurance

"If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization"

* [Code Complete Quality Assurance](./books/code_complete_quality_assurance)
* [Python Unit Test Example](./python/unit_testing)

## Maintenance

* [Code Complete Maintenance](./books/code_complete/maintenance)

## Software Metrics

* Agile Metrics

## Software Estimating

## Project Management

* [Agile Project Management](./books/agile_project_management_with_scrum)

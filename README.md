Notes on best practices, design patterns and useful tools

## [**Prerequisites**](./PREREQUISITES.md)

**The prerequisites should turn over every stone in creating a simple explanation(architecture) to describe the system solution.**

### [**0 - Requirements**](./requirements/README.md)

#### Requirements are a detailed description of what the software system is supposed to do

"Requirements are like water. They're easier to build on when they're frozen"

* [Requirements checklist](./requirements/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

### [**1 - Architecture**](./architecture/README.md)

#### Architecture is the design of constraints that apply system wide

"When you look at the architecture, you should be pleased by how natural and easayy the solution seems."

* [Architecture checklist](./architecture/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

## Construction

### [**2 - Design**](./design/README.md)

#### Design is the process of compartmentalizing the system into packages/subsystems, classes, and routines while keeping complexity to an absolute minimum

"Once you understand that all other technical goals in software are secondary to managing complexity, many design considerations become straightforward"

* ### [Design Patterns](./design_patterns)

* [Design checklist](./design/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

### [**3 - Programming**](./programming/README.md)

#### Outlining and Setup

* #### [Pseudocode Programming Process](./programming/pseudocode/README.md)

* #### [Program Organization](./programming/organization/README.md)

#### Code Blocks

* #### [**Classes**](./programming/classes/README.md)

* #### [**Routines**](./programming/routines/README.md)

#### Control Structures

* #### [If-Else Conditionals](./programming/if_else/README.md)

* #### [Loops](./programming/loops/README.md)

#### Safety

* #### [Defensive Programming](./programming/defensive_programming/README.md)

## System Quality

### [**4 - Quality Assurance**](./quality_assurance/README.md)

"If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization"

* [Code Complete checklist](./quality_assurance/CC_CHECKLIST.md)

### [5 - Testing](./quality_assurance/Code_Testing.pdf)

### [6 - Effective Debugging](./quality_assurance/Debugging.pdf)

## Maintanence

### [7 - Refactoring](./maintanence/Refactoring.pdf)

### 8 - Code Tuning

* [Why code tune?](./maintanence/tuning/Code_Tuning.pdf)
* [Tuning techniques](./maintanence/tuning/Code_Tuning_Techniques.pdf)

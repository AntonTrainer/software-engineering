# Chapter 3: Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design

## Conceptual Integrity

### Conceptual integrity is *the* most important consideration in system design

* It is better to have a system omit anomolous features, so that it can reflect one set of design ideas.
  * Dont want a bunch of (good) but independent and uncorrdinated ideas

## Achieving Conceptual Integrity

* "The purpose of a programming system is to make a computer easy to use"
* "Function, and not simplicity, has always been the measure of excellence for its designers" - which isn't wrong, just a different measure
  * Function and simplicity are the two sides of the coin
  * Also musnt confuse *simplicity* with being *straightforwards*
* "Every part must reflect the same philosophies and the same balancing of desirata. Every part must use the same techniques in syntax and anologous notions in semantics"

## Aristocracy and Democracy

* **Architecture** is the complete and detailed specification of the user interface
  * hmm
* "Architecture tells *what* happens, implementation tells us *how* it is made to happen"
* Basically, separating the architects from the implementors works as a good mechanism for supressing the billions of incoherent ideas from the implementers
* In construction, no single subcontractor is hired until the drawings are done, or nearly done.
  * Allowing disperse groups of implementors to plan is a bad idea

## [Chapter 2: The Mythical Man-Month](./CHAPTER_2.md)

"More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined"

### Brooks's Law

*Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later*

* 1/6 coding
* 1/4 component test and early system test
* 1/4 system test, all components in hand

## [Chapter 3: The Surgical Team](./CHAPTER_3.md)

"These studies revealed large individual differences between high and low performers, often by an order of magnitude"

## [Chapter 4: Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design](./CHAPTER_4.md)

Basically, separating the architects from the implementors works as a good mechanism for supressing the billions of incoherent ideas from the implementers

## [Chapter 5: The Second-System Effect](./CHAPTER_5.md)

"Add little to little and there will be a big pile"

"The second system is the most dangerous system a man ever designs"

## [Chapter 6: Passing the Word](./CHAPTER_6.md)

It is always better to ask the architect than guess and proceed

## [Chapter 7: Why Did the Tower of Babel Fail?](./CHAPTER_7.md)

SPOILER: everyone speaking different languages

## [Chapter 8: Calling the Shot](./CHAPTER_8.md)

"Extrapolations of the times for the hundred-yard dash shows that a man can run a mile in under three minutes"

* Most estimates fall short due to **company distractions** - NOT incorrect time and effort estimates

## [Chapter 9: Ten Points in a Five-Pound Sack](./CHAPTER_9.md)

* Strategy beats cleverness

## [Chapter 10: The Documentary Hypothesis](./CHAPTER_10.md)

* Use documents, as a manager, to maintain resources of all kinds

## [Chapter 11: Plan to Throw One Away](./CHAPTER_11.md)

"The only question is whether to plan in advance to build a throaway, or to promise to deliver the throwaway to customers"

## [Chapter 12: Sharp Tools](./CHAPTER_12.md)

"A good workman is known by his tools"

## [Chapter 13: The Whole and the Parts](./CHAPTER_13.md)

"'I can write programs that control air traffic, intercept ballistic missiles, reconcile bank accounts, control production lines.' To which the answer comes, "So can I, and so can any man, but do they work when you do write them?"

## [Chapter 14: Hatching a Catastrophe](./CHAPTER_14.md)

"How does a project get to be a year late? ....One day at a time"

"Usually, the disaster is due to termites, not tornadoes"

* Set **Milestones** - Events with dates
  * Milestones must be concrete, specific, measurable events defined with knife-edge sharpness

## [Chapter 15: The Other Face](./CHAPTER_15.md)

(How to document code youll forget lmao)

"What we do not understnad we do not possess"

## [Chapter 16: No Silver Bullet - Essence and Accident in Software Engineering]

"There is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity"

* Suggestions:
  * Exploit the mass market to avoid constructing what can be bought
  * Use rapid prototyping as part of a planned iteration in establishing software requirements
  * Grow software organically, adding more and more function to systems as they are run, used, and tested
  * Identify and develop the great conceptual designers of the rising generation

What is good code?

Not code that uses every single feature
Not even code that uses that many features of python
Certain clarity to where and when a feature should be used
Its code that doesnt waste the time of the person whos writing it

I have this pattern
	Python has this mechanism
		And everything very smoothly works

The language itself provides the core pieces you need
and doesnt require you to create a new framework to make something happen

Python is a language oriented around some protocol
There is some behavior
	some syntax
		some byte code
			or some top level function
				to do what you need

Remember what the features are for, not their syntax

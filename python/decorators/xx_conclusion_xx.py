Decorators are hype because:
    They can be reused
    They can decorate functions with arguments and return values
    With @functools.wraps they can look like the decorateed function

Also covered:
    Decorating classes
    Nested decorators
    Adding arguments to decorators
    Keeping state within decorators
    Using classes as decorators


Also actually found a use case where I wanted a decorator and made it
These are sweet, now I have a rough idea of where these can be used
I think itll be easier to find use cases to implement

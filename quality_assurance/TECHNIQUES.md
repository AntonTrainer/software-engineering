# Techniques for Improving Software Quality

## First: Set Objectives

* Explicitly setting quality objectives is simple, but easily overlooked
* People do well in what you ask them to do
  * Programmers have high achievement motivation
    * They will work towards the objectives specified
    * BUT, must know what those objectives are first

## General Techniques

### Set explicit quality objectives

### Define a testing strategy

### Set software engineering guidelines for

* **Problem definition**
* **Requirements development**
* **Architecture**
* **Construction**
* **System Testing**

### Leverage informal technical reviews with peers

### Perform formal technical reviews

* Goal is to catch problems when the least amount of time has been invested into a project
* Use **Quality Gates** when transitioning between
  * Requirements to archtiecture
  * Architecture to construction
  * Construction to system testing
* Just need to make sure current level is good enough before starting next level

## Development Process Techniques

### Formalize Change-Control Procedures

* Big obstace to achieveing good qulity is **uncontrolled changes**
* Huge cost implications of not following this

### Measurement of Results

* Need to track how well the QA plan is working
* Check things like:
  * Correctness
  * Usability
  * Efficiency
  * etc

### Prototype Effectively

* Develop realistic models of a systems key functions
* Prototyping leads to:
  * Better designs
  * Better matches to user needs
  * Improved maintainability

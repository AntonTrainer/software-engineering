### [Reviews](./Code_Review.pdf)

* Design reviews
  * Informal
  * Formal inspections
* Code reviews
  * Informal
  * Formal inspections
* Desk-checking of code

### Modeling or prototyping

### Testing

* Unit tests
* New component testing
* Integration testing
* Regression testing
* System testing

### USE ALL OF THESE, DONE BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE

* Code reading also detects more errors than rigid testing

# Code Complete Design Checklist

## General Goals

* [ ] Issues identified in the architecture are addressed
* [ ] Design is stratified into layers
* [ ] You are happy with how the system has been decomposed
  * [ ] subsystems
  * [ ] packages
  * [ ] classes
  * [ ] routines
* [ ] Classes are designed for minimal interaction with each other?
* [ ] Classes and subsystems designed such that they could be used in other systems
* [ ] Program will be easy to maintain
* [ ] Design is lean
* [ ] Design uses standard techniques
  * [ ] Nothing exotic
  * [ ] Nothing hard to understand
* [ ] Design minimizes complexity
  * [ ] Accidential
  * [ ] Essential

## Practices

* [ ] Has the best design out of several iterations been selected?
  * [ ] several iterations actually done
* [ ] System has been decomposed in several different ways
  * [ ] decomposed one way
  * [ ] decomposed another
* [ ] System been approached
  * [ ] Top-down
  * [ ] Bottom-up
* [ ] Rapid prototypes for
  * [ ] Risky components of the system
  * [ ] Unfamilliar components
* [ ] Design reviewed by others
  * [ ] Formally or informally
* [ ] Design is at the point where implementation is obvious
* [ ] Design work has been properly documented

## Essential Questions

* [ ] Has complexity been minimzed as much as possible?
* [ ] Has the design gone through several iterations?
* [ ] Has "What should I hide?" been asked numerous times?

## Core Goals

* [ ] Complexity is at an absolute minimum
* [ ] Design is as modular as possible
* [ ] Everything is as black boxed as possible
* [ ] Interfaces are simple and intuitive
* [ ] Functionality of each block is well defined

Using Conditionals if-then Statements

- Is the nominal code through the path clear?
- Do if-then (elif) test branch correctly on equality?
- Is the else clause present and documented?
- Is the else clause correct?
- Are if and else clauses used correctly - not reversed?
- Does the normal case follow the if rather than the else?

if-then-else-if Chains
- Are complicated tests encapsulated in boolean function calls?
- Are the most common cases tested first?
- Are all cases covered?
- Is the if-then-else-if chain the best implementation - better than a
    case statement?

case Statements
- Are cases ordered meaningfully?
- Are the actions for each case simple - calling other routines if
    necessary?
- Does the case statement test a real variable, not a phony one thats
    made up solely to use and abuse the case statement?
- Is the use of the default clause legitimate?
- Is the default clause (else) used to detect and report unexpected 
    cases?

Key Points

- For simple if-else statements, pay attention to the order of the if 
    and else clauses, especially if they process a lot of errors. 
    Make sure the nominal case is clear
- For if-then-else chains and cases statements, choose and order that
    maximizes readability
- To trap errors, use the default clause in a case statement or at 
    last else in a chain of if-then-else statements
- All control constructs are not created equal. Choose the control
    construct thats most appropriate for each section of code

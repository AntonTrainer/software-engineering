Table-Driven Methods

- Have you considered table-driven methods as an alternative to 
    complicated logic?
- Have you considered table-driven methods as an alternative to 
    complicated inheritance structures?
- Have you cinsidered storing the tables data externally and reading it
    in at runtime so the data can be modified without changing code?
- If the table cannot be accessed directly via a straightforward array
    index (as in the age example), have you put the access key 
    calcualtion into a routine rather than duplicating the index
    calculation in the code?

Key Points

- Tables provide an alternative to complicated logic and inheritence
    structures. If you find that youre confused by a programs logic
    or inheritance tree, ask youself whether you could simplify by
    using a lookup table
- One key consideration in using a table is deciding how to access the
    table. You can access tables by using direct access, indexed 
    access, or stair-step access
- Another key consideration in using a table is deciding what exactly
    to put into the table

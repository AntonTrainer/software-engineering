Organizing Straight-Line Code

- Does the code make dependencies among statements obvious?
- Do the names of routines make dependencies obvious?
- Do parameters to routines make dependencies obvious?
- Do comments describe any dependencies that would otherwise be unclear?
- Have housekeeping variables been used to check for sequential
    dependencies in critical sections of code?
- Does the code read from top to bottom?
- Are related statements grouped together?
- Have relatively independent groups of statements been moved into their
    own routines?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Points
- The strongest principle for organizing straight-line code is ordering
    dependencies
- Dependencies should be made obvious through the use of good routine
    names, parameter lists, comments, and - if the code is critical
    enough - housekeeping variables
- If the code doesnt have order dependencies, keep related statements
    as close together as possible.

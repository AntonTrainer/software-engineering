A Quality-Assurance Plan

- Have you identified specific quality characterisitcs that are 
    important to your project?
- Have you made others aware of the projects quality objectives?
- Have you differentiated between external and internal quality
    characterisitics?
- Have you thought about the ways in chich some characteristics may
    compete with or complement others?
- Does your project call for the use of several different error
    detection techniques suited to finding several different kinds of
    errors?
- Does your project include a plan to take steps to assure software 
    quality during each stage of software development?
- Is the quality measured in some way so that you can tell whether its
    improving or degrading?
- Does management understand that quality assurance incurs additional
    costs up front in order to save costs later?

Key Points

- Quality is free, in the end, but it requires a reallocation of 
    resources so that defects are prevented cheaply instead of fixed
    expensively
- Not all quality assurence goals are simultaneously achievable.
    Explicitly decide which goals you want to achieve, and communicate
    the goals to other people on your team
- No single defect detection technique is completely effective by itself
    Testing by itself is not optimally effective at removing errors.
    Successful quality-assurance programs use several different
    techniques to detect different kinds of errors
- You can apply effective techniques during construction and many
    equally powerful techniques before construction. The earlier you
    find a defect, the less intertwined it will become with the rest
    of your code and the less damage it will cause
- Quality assurance in the software arena is process-oriented.
    Software development doesnt have a repetitive phase that affects
    the final product like manufacturing does, so the quality of the 
    result is controlled by the process used to develop the software

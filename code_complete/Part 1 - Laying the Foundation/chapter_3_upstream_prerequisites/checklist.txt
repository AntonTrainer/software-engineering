Upstream Prerequisites
- Have you identified the kind of software project youre working on and
    tailored your approach appropriately?
- Are the requirements sufficiently well defined and stable enough to
    begin construction?
    --> See the requirements checklist for details
- Is the architecture sufficiently well defined to being construction?
    --> See the architecture checklist for details
- Have other risks unique to your particular project been addressed, 
    such that construction is not exposed to more risks than necessary?

Key Points
- The overarching goal of preparing for construction is risk reduction.
    Be sure your preparation activities are reducing risks, not 
    increasing them.
- If you want to develop high-quality software, attention to quality
    must be part of the software-development process from beginning to
    end. Attention to quality at the beginning has a greater influence
    on product quality than attention at the end.
- Part of a programmers job is to educate bosses and coworkers about the
    software-development process, including the importance of adequate
    preparation before programming begins
- The kind of project you're working on significantly affects 
    construction prerequisites - many projects should be highly 
    iterative, and some should be more sequential.
- If a good problem definition hasnt been specified, you might be
    solving the wrong problem during construction
- If good requirements work hasnt been done, you might have missed
    important details of the problem. Requirements changes cost 20 - 100
    times as much in the stages following construction as they do 
    earlier, so be sure the requirements are right before you start
    programming.
- If a good architectural design hasnt been done, you might be solving
    the right problem the wrong way during construction. The cost of
    architectural changes increase as more code is written for the
    wrong architecture, so be sure the architecture is right, too.
- Understand what approach has been taken to the construction
    prerequisites on your project, and choose your construction approach
    accordingly.

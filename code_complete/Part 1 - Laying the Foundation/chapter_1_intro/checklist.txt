Key Points

- Software construction is the central activity in software development;
    construction is the only activity that's guaranteed to happen on
    every project
- The main activities in construction are detailed design, coding,
    debugging, integration, and developer testing (unit testing and 
    integration testing)
- Other common terms for construction are "coding" and "programming"
- The quality of the construction substantially effects the quality
    of the software
- In the final analysis, your understanding of how to do construction
    determines how good a programmer you are, and thats the subject of
    the rest of the book

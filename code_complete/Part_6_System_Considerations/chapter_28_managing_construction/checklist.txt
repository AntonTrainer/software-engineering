Configuration Management

General
- Is your software configuration management plan designed to help 
    programmers and minimize overhead?
- Does your SCM approach avoid overcontrolling the project?
- Do you group change requests, either through informal means (such as
    a list of pending changes) or through a more systematic approach 
    (such as a change-control board)?
- Do you systematically estimate the cost, schedule, and quality impact
    of each proposed change?
- Do you view major changes as a warning that requirements development
    isnt yet complete?

Tools
- Do you use version control software to facilitate configuration
    management?
- Do you use version control software to reduce coordination problems
    of working in teams?

Backup
- Do you backup all project materials periodically?
- Are project backups transferred to off-site storage periodically?
- Are all materials backed up, including source code, documents, 
    graphics, and important notes?
- Have you tested the backup recovery system?

Key Points

- Good coding practices can be achieved either through enforced 
    standards or through more light handed approaches
- Configuration management, when properly applied, makes programmers
    jobs easier. This especially includes change control
- Good software estimation is a significant challenge. Keys to success
    are using multiple approaches, tightening down your estimates as you
    work your way into the project, and making use of data to create
    the estimates
- Measurement is a key to successful construction management. You can
    find ways to measure any aspect of a project that are better than
    not measuring it at all. Accurate measurement is a key to accurate
    scheduling, to quality control, and to improving your development
    process.
- Programmers and managers are people, and they work best when treated
    as such.

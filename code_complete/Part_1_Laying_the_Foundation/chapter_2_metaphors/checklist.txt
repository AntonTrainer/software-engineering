Key Points

- Metaphors are heuristics, not algorithms. As such, they tend to be
    sloppy
- Metaphors help you understand the software development process by
    relating it to other activities you alread know about
- Some metaphors are better than others
- Treating software construction as similar to building construction
    suggests that careful preparation in needed and illuminates the
    difference between large and small projects
- Thinking of software-development practices as tools in an intellectual
    toolbox suggests further that every programmer has many tools and
    that no single tool is right for every job. Choosing the right tool
    for each problem is one key to being an effective programmer
- Metaphors are not mutually exclusive. Use the combinations of
    metaphors that works best for you.

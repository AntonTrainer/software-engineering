Levels of Design
1) Software system
2) Division into subsystems/packages
3) Division into classes within packages
4) Division into data and routines within classes
5) Internal routine design

Level 1: Software System
First level is the entire system
Just make sure you look at class combinations before you start coding

Level 2: Division into Subsystems or Packages
Main thing is need to identify all major subsystems
    - Database, UI, business rulse, interpreter, report engine
Also need to figure out how these all communicate
    --> MAKE EACH SUBSYSTEM MEANINGFUL BY RESTRICTING COMMUINICATIONS
    - if all can communicate, there will be unintended consequences 
        in every modification to code
    --> Allow communication on a NEED TO KNOW basis
    - Easier to restrict communication early and then relax, than start
        relaxed and make strict
Keep subsystems acyclic

Level 3: Division into Classes
Define all interfaces and how each class interacts with rest of system

Level 4: Division into Routines
Pretty free reign to decompose tasks as a programmer

Level 5: Internal Routine Design
Lay out detailed functionality of individual routines

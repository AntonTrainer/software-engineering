The Pseudocode Programming Process

- Have you checked that the prerequisites have been satisfied?
- Have you defined the problem that the class will solve?
- Is the high-level design clear enough to give the class and each of
    its routines a good name?
- Have you thought about how to test the class and each of its routines?
- Have you thought about efficiency mainly in terms of stable interfaces
    and readable implementations or mainly in terms of meeting resource
    and speed budgets?
- Have you checked the standard libraries and other code libraries for
    applicable routines or components?
- Have you chedked reference books for helpful algorithms?
- Have yoou designed each routine by using detailed pseudocode?
- Have you mentally checked the pseudocode? Is it easy to understand?
- Have you paid attention to warnings that would send you back to 
    design (use of global data, operations that seem better suited for
    another class or another routine, and so on)?
- Did you translate the pseudocode to code accurately?
- Did you apply the PPP recursively, breaking routines into smaller
    routines when needed?
- Did you document assumptions as you made them?
- Did you remove comments that turned out to be redundant?
- Have you chosen the best of several iterations, rather than merely
    stopping after your first iteration?
- Do you thoroughly understand your code? Is it easy to understand?

Key Points

- Constructing classes and constructing routines tends to be an 
    iterative process. Insight gained while constructing specific 
    routines tend to ripple back through the class's design
- Writing good pseudocode calls for understandable english, avoiding
    feature specific to a single programming language, and writing at
    the level of intent (describing what the design does rather than
    how it will do it)
- The Pseudocode Programming Process is a useful tool for detailed 
    design and makes coding easy. Pseudocode translates directly into
    comments, ensuring that the comments are accurate and useful.
- Dont settle for the first design you think of. Iterate through
    multiple appriaches in pseudocode and pick the best approach before
    you begin writing code
- Check your work at each step, and encourage others to check it too.
    That way, youll catch mistakes at the least expensive level, when
    youve invested the least amount of effort

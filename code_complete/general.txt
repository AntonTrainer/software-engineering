coupling, abstraction and encapsulation go hand in hand
coupling = how tight of a connection b/w two classes
abstraction = obscuring underlying operations/removing detail
encapsulation = compartmentalized and doesnt allow for more detail
classes need to be black boxes

The best way to prepare for future work is not to design extra layers of
a base class; rather its to make current work as clear, straightforward,
and simple as possible.

Iterative design
Write pseudocode before code
Write test cases before code

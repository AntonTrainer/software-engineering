Naming Variables

General Naming Considerations
- Does the name fully and accurately describe what the variable 
    represents?
- Does the name refer to the real world problem rather than to the 
    programming language solution?
- Is the name long enough that you dont have to puzzle it out?
- Are computed-value qualifiers, if any, at the end of the name?
- Does the name use Count or Index instead of Num?

Naming Specific Kinds of Data
- Are loop index names meaningful (something other than i, j, k if the
    loop is more than one or two lines long or is nested)?
- Have all "temporary" variables been renamed to something more 
    meaningful?
- Are boolean variables named so that their meanings when theyre true
    are clear?
- Do enumerated-type names include a prefix or suffix that indicates
    the category? Color_, Planet_
- Are named constants named for the abstract entities they represent
    rather than the numbers they refer to?

Naming Conventions
- Does the convention distinguish among local, class and global data?
- Does the convention distinguish among type names, named constants, 
    enumerated types, and variables?
- Does the convention identify input-only parameters to routines in
    languages that dont enforce them?
- Is the convention as compatable as possible with standard convetions
    for the language?
- Are names formatted for readability?

Short Names
- Does the code use long names (unless its necessary to use short ones)?
- Does the code avoid abbreviations that save only one character?
- Are all words abbreviated consistently?
- Are the names pronounceable?
- Are names that could be misread or mispronounced avoided?
- Are short names documented in translation tables?

Common Naming Problems: Have You Avoided...
... names that are misleading?
... names with similar meanings?
... names that are different by only one or two characters?
... names that sound familiar?
... names that use numerals?
... names intentionally misspelled to make them shorted?
... names that are commonly misspelled in English?
... names that conflict with standard library routines names or with
    predefined variable names?
... totally arbitrary names?
... hard to read characters?

Key Points

- Good variable names are a key element of program readability. Specific
    kinds of variable ssuch as loop indexes and status variables 
    require specific considerations
- Names should be as specific as possible. Names that are vague enough 
    or general enough to be used for more than one purpose are usually
    bad names
- Naming conventions distinguish among local, class and global data. 
    They distinguish among type names, named constants, enumerated types
    and variables
- Regardless of the kind of project youre working on, you should adopt
    a variable naming convention. The kind of convention you adopt
    depends on the size of your program and the number of people working
    on it
- Abbreviatsions are rarely needed with modern programming languages. If
    you do use abbreviations, keep track of abbreviations in a project
    dictionary or use the standardized prefixes approach
- Code is read far more times than it is written. Be sure that the names
    you choose favor read-time convenience over write time convenience
